# Hashing
A simple program that uses SHA256 Hashing to compare 2 files, and will validate if they're either Identical or DIfferent. 

Was using this program to validate if transferred or uploaded files got altered from the original.

This program has lots of uses, feel free to give it a go.

Please let me know if you encounter any bugs while using it.

Thank you!
